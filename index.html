                <p >Leonardo da Vinci, given name born Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci , is a painter , sculptor , architect , musician , doctor , engineer , anatomist .Italian inventor and natural philosopher . _ He is considered the most almighty genius in human history . He is the author of famous paintings such as Mona Lisa , The Last Supper .

                    He was a man whose ideas were ahead of his time, especially the concept of helicopters , tanks , parachutes, the use of solar energy , computers , sketches of the theory of topography, double bottom boat, among many other inventions. Several of his designs were made and possible during his lifetime. Scientific applications in metalworking and in engineering in the Renaissance were still in their infancy. In addition, he contributed greatly to knowledge and understanding in anatomy , astronomy , civil engineering ,optics and the study of hydraulics . The only products left in his life are only a few paintings, along with a few notebooks (scattered in various collections of his works), inside which contain sketches, illustrations. science sketches and pens.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tieusu-item"><p style="margin-top: 23px;">Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni  commonly known as Michelangelo , was a Renaissance painter , sculptor , architect , poet, and engineer . Italy . Though he made few breakthroughs outside of the arts, his erudition in fields reached such a level that he is considered a man worthy of the title of Renaissance figure , along with rival and friend Leonardo da Vinci .

                Michelangelo's creativity in every field he was engaged in during his long life was extraordinary; When including the remaining letters, sketches, and memoirs, he is the most well-recorded artist of his life in the 16th century. Two of his most famous works are Our Lady of Sorrows and the King. David , made before he turned 30. Although he was not widely appreciated in painting, Michelangelo also created two of the most influential works of the fresco genre in the history of Western Art. : The scene of God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the Last Judgment on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. As an architect, Michelangelo was a pioneer in the Mannerist style at the Laurentian Library . At the age of 74, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica . Michelangelo changed the plan, the west corner was completed according to Michelangelo's design, the dome was completed after his death with some modifications.
                
                Another example of Michelangelo's unique position: he was the first Western artist to have a biography published while he was still alive. [2] Two biographies were published while he was alive; one of them was by Giorgio Vasari , claiming that he was the engine of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the Renaissance , a view that has continued to be advocated in art history for centuries. During his lifetime, he was also often referred to as ''Il Divino'' ("the sublime"). [3] One of his qualities most admired by his contemporaries was ''terribilità''., a sense of awe at greatness, and the efforts of later artists in his passionate and personal style led to Mannerism , the next great movement in postmodern Western art. Renaissance Peak .</p></div>
            <div class="tieusu-item"><p style="margin-top: 25px;">Vincent Willem Van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter , rated Price is one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art . In a decade, he created about 2,100 works of art, including about 860 oil paintings , most of which were painted during the last two years of his life. These include landscape , still life , portrait and   Self-portraits , characterized by bold tones and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushstrokes, have contributed to the foundation of modern art . Van Gogh was not commercially successful, and his suicide at the age of 37 came after years of struggling with depression and poverty.

                Born into a middle-class family, Van Gogh began to study painting from a young age, he was serious, quiet and thoughtful. In his youth, he worked as an art dealer , traveling frequently, but became depressed after moving to London . He spent time as a Protestant missionary in the south of Belgium . He lived in poor health and was alone before he began painting in 1881, after returning home to his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two communicated by correspondence . His first teacher was nicknamed Dieu. His early works, mainly still lifes and depictionsworking peasants , there is little indication of the vivid colors that distinguish it from his later work. In 1886 he moved to Paris , where he met many other Post-Impressionist painters, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin . As the work progressed, he created a new approach to still life painting and local landscapes . Van Gogh's paintings became brighter and brighter as he developed a style that was fully realized during his stay in Arles , in the south of France in 1888. During this period he expanded his subjectivity. Topics include olive trees , wheat fields and sunflowers .
                
                Van Gogh suffered from psychosis and paranoia , although worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat in moderation and drank a lot of alcohol. Van Gogh's friendship with Gauguin ended after an argument when, in a fit of anger, he used a razor to cut off part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including at Saint-Rémy . After being discharged from the hospital and moved to Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he was under the care of homeopathic physician Paul Gachet .. His depression continued, and on July 27, 1890, Van Gogh is said to have shot himself in the chest with a Lefaucheux revolver . [6] He died two days later.
                
                Van Gogh was not commercially successful throughout his life, he was also considered a madman and a failure. He rose to fame after his suicide and exists in the public imagination as a misunderstood genius, "the confluence of speeches of madness and creativity". [7] His fame began to grow in the early 20th century when elements of his painting style were combined by Fauvism and German Expressionism.. He achieved widespread critical, commercial, and popular success in the decades that followed, he is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled personality is typical. figure for the romantic ideals of the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings ever sold, and his legacy is honored at a museum named after him, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam , which houses the collection. The largest collection of his paintings and drawings in the world. Picasso's works are often classified according to different periods. Although the names of later periods of the artist's work are controversial, it is generally accepted to divide Picasso's early work into the Green Period (1901–1904), the Pink Age, and the Red Period. (1904–1906), African Influence - Sculpture (1908–1909), Analytical Cubism (1909–1912) and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919).

                Or as in Picasso's African Period, 1906-1909, his works are heavily inspired by African art, such as masks, sculptures, and ancient drawings. [12] . The idea of ​​​​the painting The Girls of Avignon (French is Les Demoiselles d'Avignon ) - the painting that laid the foundation and pioneered the initiation of Cubism (English is Cubism ).) - comes from Picasso's creative moment while observing works of African art at the Palais Trocadéro museum ( Palais du Trocadéro in French ) </p></div>
            <div class="tieusu-item"><p style="margin-top: 24px;">Pablo Ruiz Picasso (October 25, 1881 - April 8, 1973 ), commonly known as Pablo Picasso or Picasso , was a Spanish painter and sculptor .

His surname, Ruiz y Picasso , includes his parents' last names in the Spanish tradition. His mother's surname Picasso was from Northwestern Italy.

                From an early age, Picasso showed a passion and aptitude for painting, according to his mother, the first word that Pablo said was "piz" , short for "lápiz" " , which in Spanish means pencil [5] . Picasso's father was a realist bird painter , and José was also an art instructor and curator of the local museum, Barcelona 's School of Visual Arts . And Picasso received formal painting training from his father when he was 7 years old.
                
                Entering the Academy of Fine Arts ( Academia de San Fernando ) in Madrid for less than a year, in 1900 Picasso dropped out to go to Paris , the art center of Europe at that time. In the French capital , he lived with Max Jacob , a journalist and poet who helped Pablo learn French . This was a difficult time for the young artist when he had to live in poverty, cold and sometimes despair, most of Pablo's work had to be burned to warm their small room. In 1901 , together with his friend Soler, Picasso founded the magazine Arte Joven .in Madrid. The first issue of the magazine was completely illustrated by Pablo.
                
                In the early years of the 20th century, Picasso often traveled between the cities of Barcelona and Paris . In Paris, Picasso befriended many famous artists in the Montmartre and Montparnasse neighborhoods, including surrealist founder André Breton , poet Guillaume Apollinaire and writer Gertrude Stein . In 1911 , Picasso and Apollinaire were even arrested on suspicion of stealing the Mona Lisa from the Louvre , but they were eventually released for their innocence [6] </p></div>
